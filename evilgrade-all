The latest version of evilgrade does not work properly, so don't download evilgrade using the git clone command in the video, instead download it from the following link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2MwPqNtdQRKbGdZR2Y4MXFtTzA/view?usp=sharing

Then go to the downloads and boule click evilgrade.zip to uncompress it.

Now open a terminal and run the following commands:

cd /root/Downloads/evilgrade/
cpan Data::Dump
cpan Digest::MD5
cpan Time::HiRes
cpan RPC::XML
cp -r isrcore /etc/perl

Now the tool will work, it might display an error about Gnu.pm
this is a known bug with evil-grade, if its annoying you
the you can get rid of it using the by removing that lib using
the following command

apt-get remove libterm-readline-gnu-perl

Just make sure you re-install it after you're done in case it is
needed by other tools


apt-get install libterm-readline-gnu-perl
